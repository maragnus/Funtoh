The podcast episode we collaborated on had moments of brilliance, and his knowledge of Italian wine is undeniable. However, the process felt a bit rushed at times, and communication could\u0027ve been smoother. Overall, we created a great episode, but with a little more planning, it could have been even better. Looking forward to another chance to work together and really harness his passion \uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F."
